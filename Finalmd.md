NOTE: Weak correlation btwn Total Sales and Per Capita Sales on City
Moderate correlation btwn Total Sales and Per Capita Sales on Zipcode
and County. What this means. Although there are a lot of people in
cities it doesnâ€™t look like many are buying. Better to target via
Zipcode and County.

NOTE: Whiskey returns NA, likely because there was a city that did not
have data for whiskey. We could go looking for it and/or create a loop
to exclude that city, BUT by the correlation coefficients for the rest
of the categories we can assume that whiskey follows in suit.

We can see as population increases so does your total number of sales
which makes sense.

# PART 2 of the Research Question

## Does the avg sales per zipcode and per corresponding pattern differ across liquor categories

############################################################################## 

# NOTE: Avg sales per Category per Zip is just the amount of sales.

# Cities however we will have to calculate, BUT I can already see it

# happening againâ€¦ we will have cities with one zip code creating

# a one to one ratio between the two values and then the rest will

# appear as outliers.

# Basic way is subset for category and try and draw correlations from each
